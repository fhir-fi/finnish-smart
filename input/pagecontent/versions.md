Version 2.0.0 is the second official release of this implementation guide.

See the history of published versions in the
[publication directory](https://hl7.fi/fhir/finnish-smart/history.html).

### Notable Changes

Version 2.0.0 includes profiles depending on the
[International Patient Access (IPA)](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-ipa/) specification from
the Finnish base profiles into this specification. This is considered to be a more appropiate
guide for these profiles.

### Tracking Changes

You can track the changes between released snapshot versions through the
Previous Version Comparison section of the [QA report](qa.html). You can also check changes
between ballot and release versions through the
[releases](https://github.com/fhir-fi/finnish-smart/releases) in GitHub.

The development continues, with the intention to add more real-world examples, to get definitions
from this implementation guide into Normative level (see the
[standards development process](https://hl7.org/fhir/versions.html#std-process)) of the FHIR
specification), and to cover additional features enabled by the SMART specification.

Development snapshots will be published throughout the development, ballot, and maintenance cycles.

### CI Build Snapshots
The latest version of the `master` branch of the source code repository for this implementation
guide is published at [https://fhir.fi/finnish-smart/](https://fhir.fi/finnish-smart/).

In addition, the `master` branch and each development branch are built and published automatically
with the build.fhir.org infrastructure. You can locate the built snapshot with
the branch name. For instance, the latest commit to the `master` branch is published at
[https://build.fhir.org/ig/fhir-fi/finnish-smart/branches/master](https://build.fhir.org/ig/fhir-fi/finnish-smart/branches/master).
Or select from the
[list of available branches](https://build.fhir.org/ig/fhir-fi/finnish-smart/branches/).

You can also browse the
[list of all IG builds](https://fhir.github.io/auto-ig-builder/builds.html).

Similarly, the debug info related to the build can be found with the branch name. The build log of
the latest commit to the `master` branch is at
[https://build.fhir.org/ig/fhir-fi/finnish-smart/branches/master/build.log](https://build.fhir.org/ig/fhir-fi/finnish-smart/branches/master/build.log).

You can also track the build info at the
[#committers/notification](https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179297-committers.2Fnotification/topic/ig-build/)
channel on the [chat.fhir.org](https://chat.fhir.org) Zulip forum.
