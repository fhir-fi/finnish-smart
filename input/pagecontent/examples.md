<p class="dragon"><strong>Do not implement the SMART App Launch mechanism based on
  examples!</strong> Examples in this implementation guide are meant to offer additional clarity on
  how the SMART App Launch mechanism works in certain circumstances. However, to appreciate all the
  details of the security mechanisms involved, all implementers of the SMART App Launch mechanism
  really need to study and understand the main <a
  href="http://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/">SMART App Launch specification</a>, and the
  underlying <a href="https://oauth.net/2/">OAuth2</a> and <a
  href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a> specifications. Do give information
  security the attention it deserves!

The AuditEvent examples below capture examples of data flows of different SMART App Launch
scenarios. Note that the resource instances have minimal content. Most of the content of the
examples is in the human readable introductory part of the example pages.
